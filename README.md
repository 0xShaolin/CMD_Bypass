# CMD_Bypass
Is command prompt blocked on your school/work computers? Here is an easy fix!

## How it works:
In the cmd_bypass.py file, you have the short(yet simple) source code that explains all that is needed to run a reliable command prompt on your windows device. It is compiled using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/">Auto-Py-To-Exe</a>.

## Usage:
Simple double click the exe, same as any other regular program. Python 2.7 does not need to be preinstalled!!! (you're welcome!)
